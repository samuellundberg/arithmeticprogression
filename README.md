AP Math problem for AZsPCs, autumn 2021 http://azspcs.com/Contest/APMath.

I have made a few versions of a greedy algorithm in 1 dimension which has similar performance.

The basic greedy algorithm is also implemented for the hexagons in the competition. This scores about 0.7 points per n.
So after sending in results for the first 13 n I have just under 9 points. Apart from the algorithm not finding optimal
solutions it is also slow as it makes numerical computations in a nested loop. This makes it difficult to run the algorithm
on for the large hexagons. On my laptop it would likely take a few days.
