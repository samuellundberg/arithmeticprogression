The Elevator Pitch
Select as many cells as possible from a hexagonal grid without including any three that form an arithmetic progression.

The Details
Three cells in a hexagonal grid are said to form an arithmetic progression if one of them is exactly midway between the
other two. The following example demonstrates three arithmetic progressions.

In this contest you are asked, given a positive integer n, to select as many cells as you can from an order n regular
hexagonal grid, with no three selected cells forming an arithmetic progression. Consider the following examples for n = 3:

Submit your best solution for each of the 25 values of n in
{2, 6, 11, 18, 27, 38, 50, 65, 81, 98, 118, 139, 162, 187, 214, 242, 273, 305, 338, 374, 411, 450, 491, 534, 578}.

To submit them together you would enter:

{}, {1,3}, {1,2,4}, {1}, {2}; {2}, {1,3}, {2}, {1,3}, {1,2}
